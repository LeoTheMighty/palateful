- **A stale `app/build/unit_test_assets` makes `flutter test` lie, at scale.**
  On 2026-09-20 a July shader bundle produced **94 false failures** locally on
  a tree CI reported green — every `tester.tap(...)` test died with
  `Asset 'shaders/ink_sparkle.frag' manifest could not be decoded:
  Unsupported runtime stages format version. Expected 1, got 0.` The failure
  text reads like ordinary fixture drift ("the row I expected isn't there"),
  and three of them had already been filed as a real bug (`imptb1`) and
  dispatched to an agent before being traced back to the bundle. Fix:
  `rm -rf app/build/unit_test_assets`. Triage rule: if the failure count
  tracks *tap-driven* tests, `grep -c ink_sparkle.frag` the run — if that
  equals the failure count, it is all environmental. Note `flutter --version`
  does **not** catch this: local was correctly pinned to CI's 3.41.7
  throughout, so the obvious check passes and proves nothing.
